// Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act
// without being specifically programmed. This is done by
// implementing special algorithms that have the ability to detect
// patterns in data. From a developer point of view, this means
// creating a system that has access to relevant data, is able
// to feed the data to machine learning algorithms, and is able to
// take the output and redirect it to downstream processes and tasks.
